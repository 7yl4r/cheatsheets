Workflow for producing a report when searching for something.
A search could be a literature review, a product search, or similar.

The primary output is a spreadsheet of search results and columns relevant to the context of the requested search.

Create spreadsheet.
Do a search (using google, or whatever).
Record each finding as a row.
Add columns as they seem relevant.

Once happy with this spreadsheet, additional analysis can be done on the data collected to produce a more detailed report.
